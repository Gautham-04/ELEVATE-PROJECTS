## Detailed Findings

### 1. Apache 2.4.48 Path Traversal Vulnerability

**Severity:** Critical  
**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-42013  
**CVSS Score:** 9.8  
**Port:** TCP/80 (HTTP)  
**Plugin ID:** TCP/80

**What is this vulnerability?**

The Apache HTTP Server running on the computer is version 2.4.48 which is outdated. This version has a serious security flaw that allows attackers to access files they shouldn't be able to see and even run commands on the system without needing a password.

**How does it work?**

An attacker can send special web requests with encoded characters like %2e to trick the server into showing files outside the web folder. If a certain module called mod_cgi is enabled, they can even execute commands and take full control of the computer.

**What could happen if exploited?**

- Attacker can read sensitive files on the system
- Attacker can execute commands remotely
- Complete system compromise
- Data theft
- Installation of malware

**How to fix it:**

1. Update Apache HTTP Server to version 2.4.51 or newer
2. If you cannot update immediately, disable the mod_cgi module
3. Use a firewall to block access to port 80 from untrusted sources
4. After updating, verify the version by running: apache2 -v

### 2. SSLv3 POODLE Protocol Vulnerability

**Severity:** Medium  
**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-3566  
**CVSS Score:** 4.3  
**Port:** TCP/443 (HTTPS)  
**Plugin ID:** TCP/443

**What is this vulnerability?**

The web server accepts connections using an old and insecure protocol called SSL 3.0. This protocol has a known weakness called POODLE attack that allows attackers to decrypt encrypted information.

**How does it work?**

If an attacker is on the same network (like public WiFi), they can force the connection to use the old SSL 3.0 protocol and then decrypt the encrypted data by sending many requests. This lets them steal cookies, passwords, and other sensitive information.

**What could happen if exploited?**

- Session cookies can be stolen
- Login credentials can be intercepted
- Personal information can be read
- Account hijacking

**How to fix it:**

1. Disable SSL 3.0 protocol in the web server configuration
2. Enable only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 protocols
3. Update the cipher suites to use only strong encryption
4. Test the configuration using SSL Labs website

For Apache, edit the configuration file and add:
```
SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
```

Then restart the Apache service.

### 3. TCP Port 8080 Open

**Severity:** Informational  
**Port:** TCP/8080  
**Plugin ID:** TCP/8080

**What is this finding?**

The scan detected that port 8080 is open on the system. This is not a vulnerability by itself but it means some service is running on that port. Port 8080 is commonly used for web servers, development tools, or proxy services.

**Why is this important?**

Having unnecessary ports open increases the attack surface. If the service on port 8080 is not needed or is misconfigured, it could be an entry point for attackers.

**What to do:**

1. Find out what service is using port 8080
   - Run: netstat -ano | findstr :8080
   - Run: Get-Process -Id [PID number from above]

2. If the service is not needed:
   - Stop the service
   - Disable it from starting automatically
   - Block the port using Windows Firewall

3. If the service is needed:
   - Make sure it is updated to the latest version
   - Check if it requires authentication
   - Configure firewall to allow only specific IP addresses

## System Configuration Issues

While reviewing the system, I also checked some basic security settings:

**Windows Updates:**
- Need to check if all security updates are installed
- Recommend enabling automatic updates

**Windows Firewall:**
- Should verify that firewall is enabled for all network profiles

**Windows Defender:**
- Should check if real-time protection is enabled
- Verify that virus definitions are up to date

**SMB Configuration:**
- Should check if SMBv1 is disabled (it is outdated and insecure)

## Remediation Plan

I created a plan to fix these issues in order of priority:

### Priority 1: Critical Issues (Fix within 24 hours)

1. Update Apache HTTP Server to version 2.4.51 or higher
2. If update is not possible immediately, disable mod_cgi module
3. Verify the fix by testing the exploit URL

### Priority 2: Medium Issues (Fix within 1 week)

1. Disable SSL 3.0 protocol on the HTTPS service
2. Enable only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3
3. Test with SSL Labs to confirm SSLv3 is disabled

### Priority 3: Informational (Fix within 2 weeks)

1. Identify the service running on port 8080
2. Determine if it is necessary
3. Either secure it properly or disable it

### Ongoing Maintenance

- Run vulnerability scans monthly
- Enable automatic Windows updates
- Keep all software up to date
- Review open ports regularly

## Risk Analysis

### Critical Risk (Apache vulnerability):

**Likelihood:** High - There are public exploits available and attackers are actively using them

**Impact:** Critical - Attacker can take complete control of the system

**Business Impact:**
- Loss of data
- System downtime
- Possible legal issues if customer data is stolen
- Damage to reputation

### Medium Risk (SSL vulnerability):

**Likelihood:** Medium - Requires attacker to be on same network

**Impact:** Medium - Can steal session cookies and passwords

**Business Impact:**
- Unauthorized access to accounts
- Loss of customer trust
- Data interception

## Verification Steps

After fixing the vulnerabilities, these steps should be taken to verify:

1. For Apache update:
   - Check version: apache2 -v
   - Try the exploit URL to make sure it is blocked

2. For SSLv3 fix:
   - Run: openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 -ssl3
   - Should fail to connect
   - Test on SSL Labs website

3. For port 8080:
   - Verify service is stopped or secured
   - Check firewall rules are in place

4. Run another Nessus scan to confirm all issues are resolved

## Lessons Learned

From this vulnerability scan, I learned:

1. Regular patching is very important. The Apache vulnerability has been fixed for a while but this system was not updated.

2. Old protocols like SSLv3 should be disabled even if they are not actively causing problems.

3. It is important to know what services are running on the system and keep an inventory.

4. Vulnerability scanning should be done regularly, not just once.

---

## Recommendations

Based on this scan, I recommend:

1. Set up automatic patching for the system
2. Subscribe to security mailing lists for software we use
3. Perform vulnerability scans monthly
4. Create a list of all services running on the system
5. Harden the system configuration using security best practices
6. Enable logging and monitoring for suspicious activity

---

## Conclusion

The vulnerability scan found serious security issues that need immediate attention. The Apache vulnerability is critical and must be fixed within 24 hours because attackers are actively exploiting it. The SSL vulnerability should be fixed within a week. The open port should be investigated and secured within two weeks.

After all vulnerabilities are fixed, the system security posture will improve from CRITICAL to LOW RISK.

I will schedule a follow-up scan in one week after the remediation is complete to verify that all issues have been resolved.
